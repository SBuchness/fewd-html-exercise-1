  <p>IN <q><cite><a href="http://danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/">CONTENT Display Patterns</cite></a></cite></q> (which all front-end folk should read), Dan Mall points to a truth not unlike the one <a href="https://24ways.org/2015/putting-my-patterns-through-their-paces/">Ethan Marcotte shared last month</a> on 24 ways. It is a truth as old as standards-based design: Construct your markup to properly support your content (not your design).</p><br>
	<p>Modular/<a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">atomic design</a> doesn&apos;t change this truth, it just reinforces its wisdom. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">Flexbox</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">grid layout</a> don&apos;t change this truth, they just make it easier to do it better. <a href="http://html5forwebdesigners.com/design/index.html">HTML5</a> doesn&apos;t change this truth, it just reminds us that the separation of structure from style came into existence for a reason. A reason that hasn&apos;t changed. A reason that cannot change, because it is the core truth of the web, and is inextricably bound up with the promise of this medium.</p><br>
	<p>Separating structure from style and behavior was the web standards movement&apos;s prime revelation, and each generation of web designers discovers it anew. This separation is what makes our content as backward-compatible as it is forward-compatible (or <q><a href="http://futurefriendlyweb.com/">future-friendly,</a></q> if you prefer). It&apos;s the key to re-use. The key to accessibility. The key to the new kinds of CMS systems we&apos;re just beginning to dream up. It&apos;s what makes our content as accessible to an ancient device as it will be to an unimagined future one.</p><br>
	<p>Every time a leader in our field discovers, as if for the first time, the genius of this separation between style, presentation, and behavior, she is validating the brilliance of web forbears like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kon_Wium_Lie">H&aring;kon Wium Lie</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Bos">Bert Bos</a>.</p><br>

	<p>Every time a Dan or an Ethan (or a <a href="https://sarasoueidan.com/">Sara</a> or a <a href="http://lea.verou.me/">Lea</a>) writes a beautiful and insightful article like the two cited above, they are telling new web designers, and reminding experienced ones, that this separation of powers matters.</p><br>
	<p>And they are plunging a stake into the increasingly slippery ground beneath us.</p><br>
	<p>Why is it slippery? Because too many developers and designers in our amnesiac community have begun to believe and share bad ideas &mdash; ideas, like CSS isn&apos;t needed, HTML isn&apos;t needed, <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement">progressive enhancement</a> is old-fashioned and unnecessary, and so on. Ideas that, if followed, will turn the web back what it was becoming in the late 1990s: a wasteland of walled gardens that said no to more people than they welcomed. Let that never be so. We have the power.</p><br>
	<p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides">Maimonides</a>, were he alive today, would tell us: he who excludes a single user destroys a universe. Web standards now and forever.</p><br>
